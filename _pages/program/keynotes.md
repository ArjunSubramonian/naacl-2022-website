**Title:** Shaping Technology with Moral Imagination: Leveraging the Machinery of Value Sensitive Design

**Time:** Monday, July 11, 9:15--10:15

**Abstract:**
Tools and technologies are fundamental to the human condition. They do no less than
create and structure the conditions in which we live, express ourselves, enact society,
and experience what it means to be human. They are also the result of our moral and
technical imaginations. Yet, with our limited view, it is not at all obvious how to design
and engineer tools and technology so that they are more likely to support the actions,
relationships, institutions, and experiences that human beings care deeply about â€“ a life
and society of human flourishing.

Value Sensitive Design (VSD) was developed as an approach to address this challenge
from within technical design processes. Drawing on over three decades of work, in this
plenary talk I will provide an introduction to value sensitive design foregrounding human
values in the technical design process. My remarks will present some of value sensitive
designâ€™s core theoretical constructs. Along the way, Iâ€™ll provide some examples of
applying value sensitive design to robots for healthcare and to bias in computing
systems as well as demonstrate one toolkitâ€”The Envisioning Cardsâ€”in the context of a
design activity.

As time permits, I will turn to a discussion of structure, scale and time: we act within
existing structure in the now, from which futures unfold across time and scale. I will
unpack these observations and their implications for artificial intelligence and machine
learning technologies. Thinking longer-term and systemically, I will bring forward a
range of potential challenges and offer some constructive ways forward.
My comments will engage individual lives, society writ large, what it means to be
human, the planet and beyond.

Please have scratch paper and a pencil handy for the design activity.

**Speaker Bio:**
[Batya Friedman](https://vsdesign.org/) is a Professor in the Information School and holds adjunct appointments in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, the School of Law, and the Department of Human Centered Design and Engineering at the University of Washington where she co-founded the Value Sensitive Design Lab and the UW Tech Policy Lab. Dr. Friedman pioneered value sensitive design (VSD), an established approach to account for human values in the design of technical systems. Her work in value sensitive design has resulted in robust theoretical constructs, dozens of innovative methods, and practical toolkits such as the Envisioning Cards. Value sensitive design has been widely adopted nationally and internationally where it has been used in architecture, biomedical health informatics, civil engineering, computer security, energy, global health, human-computer interaction, human-robotic interaction, information management, legal theory, moral philosophy, tech policy, transportation, and urban planning, among others. Additionally, value sensitive design is emerging in higher education, government, and industry as a key approach to address computing ethics and responsible innovation. Today, Dr. Friedman is working on open questions in value sensitive design including multi-lifespan design, and designing for and with non-human stakeholders â€“ questions critical for the wellbeing of human societies and the planet. 
 
Dr. Friedmanâ€™s 2019 MIT Press book co-authored with David Hendry, Value Sensitive Design: Shaping Technology with Moral Imagination, provides a comprehensive account of value sensitive design. In 2012 Dr. Friedman received the ACM-SIGCHI Social Impact Award and the University Faculty Lecturer award at the University of Washington, in 2019 she was inducted into the CHI Academy, in 2020 she received an honorary doctorate from Delft University of Technology, and in 2021 she was recognized as an ACM Fellow. She is also a stone sculptor and mixed media artist. Dr. Friedman received both her B.A. and Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley.

**Title:** NLP in Mexican Spanish: One of many stories

**Time:** Wednesday, July 13, 16:15--17:15

**Abstract:**
Spanish is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, however, the
development of language technologies for it has not been in the same
proportion. This is particularly true for some of its Latin American variants, such
as the Mexican Spanish. This talk will focus on presenting the development of
NLP for Mexican Spanish, emphasizing one of its many research stories related
to the analysis of social media content.

This talk will present some data on the languages spoken in Mexico and on the
development of the area of Natural Language Processing in our country, and
will describe a research project that combined the efforts of several groups: the
identification of abusive language in Mexican tweets. The talk will conclude by
exposing some calls for collaboration, with the intention of increasing and
improving the research in Mexican Spanish as well as in the many indigenous
languages spoken in Mexico.

**Speaker Bio:**
Manuel Montes-y-GÃ³mez is Full Professor at the National Institute of Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics (INAOE) of Mexico. His research is on automatic text processing. He is author of more than 250 journal and conference papers in the fields of information retrieval, text mining and authorship analysis.

He has been visiting professor at the Polytechnic University of Valencia (Spain), and the University of Alabama (USA). He is also a member of the Mexican Academy of Sciences (AMC), and founding member of the Mexican Academy of Computer Science (AMEXCOMP), the Mexican Association of Natural Language Processing (AMNLP), and of the Language Technology Network of CONACYT.

## Panel: The Place of Linguistics and Symbolic Structures
{: #panel-linguistics-symbolic-structures}

**Time:** Tuesday, July 12, 9:15--10:15

The widespread adoption of neural models in NLP research and the fact that NLP applications increasingly mediate peopleâ€™s lives have prompted many discussions about what productive research directions might look like for our community. Since NAACL is a meeting of a chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, we would like to highlight specifically the role that linguistics and symbolic structures can play (or not) in shaping these research directions.
