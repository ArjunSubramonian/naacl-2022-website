### Recognition of They/Them as Singular Personal Pronouns in Coreference Resolution
###### NAACL Main Conference
We propose a method to test coreference resolution systems' ability to differentiate singular and plural they/them pronouns. We find that existing systems are biased toward resolving “they” pronouns as plural, even when the correct resolution is clear to humans.

### Measuring Alignment Bias in Neural Seq2Seq Semantic Parsers
###### *SEM: The Eleventh Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics

In this work we investigate whether neural semantic parsers with a seq2seq architecture have a bias for monotonic or non-monotonic alignments. To answer this question we augment the popular Geo semantic parsing dataset with alignment annotations and create Geo-Aligned. We then study the performance of standard seq2seq models on the examples that can be aligned monotonically versus examples that require more complex alignments. Our empirical study shows that performance is significantly better over monotonic alignments.

### A Holistic Framework for Analyzing the COVID-19 Vaccine Debate
###### NAACL Main Conference

The Covid-19 pandemic has led to infodemic of low quality information leading to poor health decisions. Combating the outcomes of this infodemic requires reasoning about the decisions individuals make.

### Reducing conversational agents' overconfidence through linguistic calibration
###### NAACL Main Conference

We evaluate state-of-the-art chatbots for closed-book QA accuracy, finding that these models are poorly linguistically calibrated---meaning that the amount of confidence or hedging expressed linguistically does not correspond to change of correctness. We do however find that likelihood of correctness can accurately be predicted from model representations. By incorporating such metacognitive features into the training of a controllable generation model, we obtain a dialogue agent with greatly improved linguistic calibration.

### Imagination-Augmented Natural Language Understanding
###### NAACL Main Conference

Human brains integrate linguistic and perceptual information simultaneously to understand natural language, and hold the critical ability to render imaginations. Such abilities enable us to construct new abstract concepts or concrete objects, and are essential in involving practical knowledge to solve problems in low-resource scenarios. Therefore,  we introduce an Imagination-Augmented Cross-modal Encoder (iACE) to solve natural language understanding tasks from a novel learning perspective -- imagination-augmented cross-modal understanding.

### Pre-training Data Quality and Quantity for a Low-Resource Language: New Corpus and BERT Models for Maltese
###### Deep Learning for Low-Resource NLP (DeepLo)

We release new Maltese BERT-based language models which use significantly less data than the corpora used by other high-resource languages. Furthermore, we find that using carefully curated pre-training is important and at times results in significant improvements. Our analysis shows that the amount of data needed to achieve considerable improvements, does not need to be overly ambitious.

### Less is More: Learning to Refine Dialogue History for Personalized Dialogue Generation
###### NAACL Main Conference

Since the dialogue history is usually long and noisy, most existing methods truncate the dialogue history to model the user's personality. We propose to refine the user dialogue history on a large scale, based on which we can handle more dialogue history and obtain more abundant and accurate persona information.

### BlonDe: An Automatic Evaluation Metric for Document-level Machine Translation
###### NAACL Main Conference

Is BLEU sufficient for document-level machine translation? The answer is no, as texts have properties beyond their individual sentences. BlonDe is an alternative automatic metric for document-level MT evaluation. As shown by experiments and human evaluation, BlonDe is a lot more selective than BLEU for document-level MT and shows a larger quality difference between human and machine translations.

**Author Bio:** Eleanor is a second-year Ph.D. at ETH Zürich. Her research focuses on generating and understanding long texts. To this end, she has recently been dabbling into document-level machine translation, coreference resolution, and coherence modeling. She also likes fun applications of natural language generation (news generation, lyrics generation, etc.).

### Commonsense and Named Entity Aware Knowledge Grounded Dialogue Generation
###### NAACL Main Conference

Despite demonstrating efficacy in empirical evaluation, past work for the task of Dialogue Generation has a few significant drawbacks. There is no explicit representation of entities, semantic relations, or conversation structures, in particular. We propose CNTF, a novel knowledge grounded dialogue generation model that utilizes dialogue context, unstructured textual information, and structural knowledge to facilitate explicit reasoning.

### Private NLP workshop, paper 5: Training Text-to-Text Transformers with Privacy Guarantees
###### PrivateNLP

Recent high-capacity Large Language Models (LLMs) are pre-trained on huge corpus of data that is usually treated public. This data can still contain personally identifiable information, such as names, phone numbers, and copyrighted material. In this work we investigate Differential Privacy for private pre-training of LLMs and demonstrate that downstream tasks are not affected by this. Further we show that DP helps with memorization and can be implemented at moderate cost in training speed.

### What do Users Care About? Detecting Actionable Insights from User Feedback
###### NAACL Main Conference

Users often leave feedback on a myriad of aspects of a product which, if leveraged successfully, can help yield useful insights that can lead to further improvements down the line. Detecting actionable insights can be challenging owing to large amounts of data as well as the absence of labels in real-world scenarios. In this work, we present an aggregation and graph-based ranking strategy for unsupervised detection of these insights from real-world, noisy, user-generated feedback. Our proposed approach significantly outperforms strong baselines on two real-world user feedback datasets and one academic dataset.

### KETOD: Knowledge-Enriched Task-Oriented Dialogue

Existing studies in dialogue system research mostly treat task-oriented dialogue and chit-chat as separate domains. Towards building a human-like assistant that can converse naturally and seamlessly with users, it is important to build a dialogue system that conducts both types of conversations effectively. In this work, we investigate how task-oriented dialogue and knowledge-grounded chit-chat can be effectively integrated into a single model.

### Data-driven Model Generalizability in Crosslinguistic Low-resource Morphological Segmentation

###### NAACL Main Conference

Common designs of model evaluation typically focus on monolingual settings, where different models are compared according to their performance on a single data set that is assumed to be representative of all possible data for the task at hand. While this may be reasonable for a large data set, this assumption is difficult to maintain in low-resource scenarios, where artifacts of the data collection can yield data sets that are outliers, potentially making conclusions about model performance coincidental. We illustrate these concerns using morphological segmentation as a test case.

we present a novel versatile adaptive curriculum learning (VACL) framework, which presents a substantial step toward applying automatic curriculum learning on dialogue policy tasks. It supports evaluating the difficulty of dialogue tasks only using the learning experiences of dialogue policy and skip-level selection according to their learning needs to maximize the learning efficiency. Moreover, an attractive feature of VACL is the construction of a generic, elastic global curriculum while training a good dialogue policy that could guide different dialogue policy learning without extra effort on re-training.

### On the Origin of Hallucinations in Conversational Models: Is it the Datasets or the Models?
###### NAACL Main Conference

Knowledge-grounded conversational models are known to suffer from producing factually invalid statements, a phenomenon commonly called hallucination. We conduct a comprehensive human study on both existing knowledge-grounded conversational benchmarks and several state-of-the-art models. Our study reveals that the standard benchmarks consist of >60% hallucinated responses, leading to models that not only hallucinate but even amplify hallucinations.

### Modeling Framing in Immigration Discourse on Social Media (Poster at WiNLP satellite workshop, paper published at NAACL 2021)
###### WiNLP satellite workshop

The framing of political issues can influence policy and public opinion. By creating a new dataset of immigration-related tweets labeled for multiple framing typologies from political communication theory, we develop supervised models to detect frames. We demonstrate how users’ ideology and region impact framing choices, and how a message’s framing influences audience responses.

### How Gender Debiasing Affects Internal Model Representations, and Why It Matters
###### NAACL Main Conference

Common studies of gender bias in NLP focus either on extrinsic bias measured by model performance on a downstream task or on intrinsic bias found in models' internal representations. However, the relationship between extrinsic and intrinsic bias is relatively unknown. This study bridges the gap between extrinsic and intrinsic evaluations. Our framework provides a comprehensive perspective on bias in NLP models, which can be applied to deploy NLP systems in a more informed manner.

**Author Bio:** I am a first year PhD student in the Technion, advised by Yonatan Belinkov. I am interested in understanding, defining and improving robustness in NLP models. This includes social biases and other biases resulting from spurious correlations in the data.

### Identifying Human Needs through Social Media: A study on Indian cities during COVID-19
###### In the 10th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media.

During crisis, people often express their needs and struggles through social media posts. Taking inspiration from Frustration-Aggression theory, we propose a model to classify tweets expressing frustration which serves as an indicator of unmet needs. Our study reveals the major causes behind feeling frustrated during the lockdown and the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Our proposed approach can be useful in timely identification and prioritization of emerging human needs in the event of a crisis.

**Author Bio:** This paper will be presented by Rohan Joseph. Rohan Joseph is a final year B.Tech student at the Mahindra University, India. His research focuses on metaphor generation and human needs detection on social media. He aims to design NLP solutions for social well being and would like to further his learning through interdisciplinary collaborations.

### Beyond Emotion: Α Multi-Modal Dataset for Human Desire Understanding
###### NAACL Main Conference

Desire is a strong wish to do or have something, which involves not only a linguistic expression, but also underlying cognitive phenomena driving human feelings. As a strikingly understudied task, it is difficult for machines to model and understand desire due to the unavailability of benchmarking datasets with desire and emotion labels. To bridge this gap, we present MSED, the first multi-modal and multi-task sentiment, emotion and desire dataset, which contains 9,190 text-image pairs.

**Author Bio:** <span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif; ">Ao Jia</span> is a undergraduate student in Beijing Institute of Technology. Their work intends to explore desire detection in NLP.
